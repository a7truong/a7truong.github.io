            <p class="text-muted" align="justify">I am currently a third year student at the University of Waterloo (uWaterloo) pursing my career in Computer and Finance. Classes I've taken have helped me explore the fields of both programming and finance. Courses at the University of Waterloo exposed me to extensive programming, problem solving and financial concepts.</p>  
            <p class="text-muted" align="justify">In computer science, the University of Waterloo has helped me develop formal programming skills. Classes at the university taught me the syntax of the programming languages; I've learned both functional and imperative perspectives on programming. In the functional paradigm, we were taught Scheme (Racket); Scheme is a mathematical based programming language. Also, imperative programming languages include C and C++.</p>
            <p class="text-muted" align="justify">The Computing and Financial Management program also offers the financial perspective. uWaterloo has taught me different topics such as Financial/Managerial Accounting, Economics, and Corporate Finance.</p>
            <p class="text-muted" align="justify">Some technology interests I have include the Linux Command-line, scripting (i.e.: Bash, PowerShell), application development (i.e.: iOS, Android), and new technologies such as smartphones, computers, and other gadgets. In addition to technology, I am also interested in the financial perspective of the company with their earnings and initial public offerings (IPOs). Outside of my education, I enjoy watching and playing sports. I play ball hockey in both friendly and competitive environments; the most recent tournament I was involved  in was the Toronto PlayOn! 4 on 4 event. This event is registered as the largest ball hockey event in Canada.</p>
